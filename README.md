This is the text-based version of 7Wars, its one of my first games and is
fairly straight-foward.

Install: To install all you need is python 2.7 and the latest version of
pygame.

To Play: Just cd to where you saved the file (in terminal type $ cd /where/you
/stored/thefile) then when you're ready to play enter ($ python SevenWars.py)
voila!

Entering commands: This is a basic text adventure, all the commands that are
accepted in the game are capitalized, for example 'Walkway or Sewers' means
these are the commands, just simply enter Walkway to make a choice (or Sewers
either is fine)!
